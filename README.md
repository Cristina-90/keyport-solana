Decentralized mutual reputation for rentals — portable, private, and on-chain.

# 🏠 KeyPort — Decentralized Rental Reputation

**KeyPort** is a Web3 protocol that builds **trust between tenants and landlords** across borders — private, portable, and fair.

---

## 🌍 Problem

Moving to a new country often means starting from zero:  

**Tenants** have no local rental references, and landlords face growing fraud and mistrust.  
Existing systems (credit scores, review platforms) are **centralized, fragmented, and privacy-invasive**.

In Berlin, finding housing has become increasingly difficult due to widespread scams and fake apartment listings.

For many **digital nomads, students, and professionals** who move across countries, bringing **valid rental references is a tedious and often impossible process — documents are in different languages, formats, and rarely recognized abroad.**

**Landlords, on the other hand, struggle to verify foreign tenants.** A reliable, honest person can still be rejected simply for lacking local paperwork, often resulting in unfairly high deposits or lost opportunities.

Meanwhile, **rental platforms collect and monetize user data,** turning personal reputation into corporate profit instead of individual empowerment.

---

## 💡 Solution

**KeyPort** creates a **decentralized reputation system** where both tenants and landlords can:

- Exchange **verified attestations** of rental history.  
- Earn a **Reputation Badge NFT** that reflects trust and experience.  
- Use **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** to prove reliability **without exposing personal data**.  

All built on **Solana** — for speed, low fees, and composability.

## 💡 The Solution — Building Trust with Blockchain

**KeyPort is a decentralized reputation protocol system** that connects tenants and landlords through verified, privacy-preserving proofs — powered by **Solana.**

🏠 **Verified Attestations**
Each rental interaction is recorded as a **cryptographic proof on-chain** — immutable, transparent, and 1000× cheaper thanks to **Solana’s compressed accounts.**

🔐 **Protected Identity**
With **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs),** users can demonstrate reliability without revealing personal data like passport numbers or income details.

🎖️ **Reputation Badges**
Both tenants and landlords **earn dynamic NFT Badges that reflect trust and history** — portable across platforms and borders.

⚖️ **Two-Way Accountability**
Reputation grows in both directions: **bad landlords are visible, and honest tenants are rewarded.**

🌐 **Truly Yours**
Your **reputation lives in your wallet,** not in a company’s database — **private, permanent, and always accessible.**

⚡ **Powered by Solana**
Built for **global scale — fast (400ms), affordable (<$0.01), and composable (65K+ TPS)** to support millions of secure attestations worldwide.

## 🌍 Vision — Building Global Trust

We’re building a **global digital reputation layer** that replaces outdated credit checks and enables **mutual trust** between people, anywhere in the world.  

A system where your rental history, reliability, and honesty **travel with you** — private, portable, and blockchain-verified.  

Housing should be built on **trust**, not borders.  

**KeyPort** sets a new standard for digital reputation — one that belongs to you, lives in your wallet, and moves freely across platforms and countries.  

Whether you’re a **developer, designer, or believer in open systems**, join us in shaping the future of **fair, borderless renting**.
